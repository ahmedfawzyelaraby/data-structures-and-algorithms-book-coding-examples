# Data Structures and Algorithms Book Coding Examples
This repo contains C++ implementations for all the coding examples of [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18308002-data-structures-and-algorithms) book.
## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. **Please be noted that this code is tested on Ubuntu OS only**.
### Prerequisites
In order to be able to use this code, you need to run the following commands:
```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install cmake git build-essential
```
### Installation
To run the C++ examples' implementations in this repo, you can either download the already build artifacts from the latest job in the **Actions** tab or you can run the following commands:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ahmedfawzyelaraby/data-structures-and-algorithms-book-coding-examples.git
$ cd data-structures-and-algorithms-book-coding-examples
$ cd [to-the-example-you-want-to-run]
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
### Run
To run the examples you will need to check the implemented code to the expected input from each of them.
